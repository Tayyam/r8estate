The main issue in this file is a syntax error in the Reviews List section. There's an incomplete ternary operator and some misplaced code. Here's the corrected version of that section:

```jsx
{/* Reviews List */}
<div className="space-y-6" ref={reviewsRef}>
  {loading && !reviewsLoaded ? (
    renderLoadingPlaceholder()
  ) : reviews.length > 0 ? (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Rest of the reviews list code */}
    </div>
  ) : null}
</div>
```

I've added the missing closing brackets and fixed the ternary operator structure. The rest of the file appears to be syntactically correct. The complete file should now work as expected.

Note that there were also some missing closing brackets at the very end of some components and JSX elements, but they were included in the original file structure. The main issue was in the Reviews List section where the ternary operator was improperly formatted.
